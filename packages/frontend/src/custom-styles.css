Force a larger font size on the progress graph's axis labels.
The default React Flow styles override inline styles and utility classes,
so we need a more specific rule with !important to ensure this is applied.
The SVG scales, so we need a larger base font size to ensure readability.

Ensure proper text wrapping in chat bubbles with flexbox.
The prose container uses max-w-none which can conflict with flexbox shrinking.
We need to ensure all text content, code blocks, and inline elements can wrap properly.
This is critical for preventing horizontal overflow in narrow viewports.
