# Future Vision: Full Integration with Cursor CLI

This document outlines a long-term architectural concept for deeply integrating the LifeCurrents application with the Cursor CLI to create a seamless, semi-automated development and reconciliation workflow.

## Core Concept

The fundamental idea is to leverage the existing LifeCurrents chat interface as a custom front-end for the Cursor CLI. While the CLI does not support true "forking" of conversations in the IDE, its ability to resume specific conversations can be used as a foundation for programmatic interaction.

By integrating the CLI, we could automate many of the steps that currently require manual intervention or complex orchestration within our primary chat here.

## Key Potential Features

1.  **Templated, One-Click Actions:** We could create buttons or commands within the LifeCurrents UI that trigger complex, multi-step actions by calling the Cursor CLI with pre-defined, templated prompts.
    *   **Automated Prompt Generation:** Instead of me generating a prompt here for you to copy, a high-level directive in the LifeCurrents chat could be sent to a background Cursor CLI process, which would then generate the final, detailed prompt for the Claude agent.
    *   **One-Click Reconciliation:** A "Reconcile & Commit" button in our dashboard could trigger a background Cursor CLI instance. It would be fed a specialized prompt containing the context of our main project, the diffs from all the approved PRs, and a directive to perform the merge.
    *   **Automated Commits:** The final output of a successful reconciliation from the CLI could be a direct commit to the main branch, fully automating the final step of the workflow.

2.  **Unified UI:** The local Windows dashboard and our chat here could eventually be consolidated into the LifeCurrents application itself. The app would become the single pane of glass for managing development tasks, viewing their status, verifying results, and triggering their final integration.

## Technical Considerations & Hurdles

*   **CLI Limitations:** The viability of this entire concept hinges on the capabilities and stability of the Cursor CLI and how effectively it can interact with conversation histories outside of the main IDE.
*   **Context Management:** We would need to solve the problem of passing the vast context of our primary development conversation into the isolated, programmatically-triggered CLI conversations. The existing summarization and context-engineering logic within LifeCurrents could potentially be adapted for this purpose.
*   **Significant Refactoring:** This would represent a major expansion of the LifeCurrents project's scope, requiring significant changes to its architecture to incorporate these new responsibilities.

## Conclusion

This is a "next-generation" feature that we will hold off on implementing until the foundational workflow (Tauri Dashboard -> Cloudflare -> GitHub Action) is built, tested, and validated. This document serves as a record of this strategic vision.
